# Upload Fix and Branding Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Post-Upload Navigation Issue

**Problem:** After uploading a PDF resource, users were redirected to the resource detail page but saw "Resource Not Found" error.

**Root Cause:** The navigation was happening too quickly, before the database transaction was fully committed and visible to the query on the detail page.

**Solution:** Added a 500ms delay after resource creation to ensure the database transaction completes before navigation.

**File Modified:** `src/pages/marketplace/UploadResourcePage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));` after successful resource creation
- Added better error logging with `console.error` for debugging
- Added validation to check both `resource` and `resource.id` exist before navigation
- Improved error messages for better user feedback

**Code Change:**
```typescript
if (resource && resource.id) {
  toast({
    title: 'Resource Uploaded',
    description: 'Your resource has been uploaded successfully!'
  });
  
  // Small delay to ensure database transaction completes
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
  
  // Navigate to the resource detail page
  navigate(`/marketplace/${resource.id}`);
} else {
  console.error('Resource creation failed - no resource or ID returned');
  toast({
    title: 'Upload Failed',
    description: 'Failed to upload resource. Please try again.',
    variant: 'destructive'
  });
}
```

### 2. Rebranded Website to "Uppoo"

**Changed:** All references to "Therapy Activity Authoring Studio" have been updated to "Uppoo"

**Files Modified:**
1. `index.html` - Updated page title to "Uppoo - Therapy Activity Authoring Platform"
2. `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Changed main heading to "Uppoo"
3. `src/pages/Signup.tsx` - Updated signup description to "Join Uppoo"
4. `src/pages/ViewAAC.tsx` - Changed footer text to "Created with Uppoo"
5. `src/pages/ViewSchedule.tsx` - Changed footer text to "Created with Uppoo"
6. `src/components/common/Header.tsx` - Updated logo text to "Uppoo"

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Upload Flow Test:**
   - Log in as a therapist
   - Navigate to Marketplace → Upload Resource
   - Upload a PDF file
   - Fill in all required fields
   - Submit the form
   - Verify you are redirected to the resource detail page
   - Verify the resource displays correctly with all information

2. **Branding Verification:**
   - Check browser tab title shows "Uppoo - Therapy Activity Authoring Platform"
   - Verify header logo shows "Uppoo"
   - Check home page heading shows "Uppoo"
   - Verify signup page shows "Join Uppoo"
   - Check AAC and Schedule viewer footers show "Created with Uppoo"

## Technical Notes

- The 500ms delay is a pragmatic solution that works well for most database operations
- If issues persist, consider implementing a polling mechanism or using Supabase real-time subscriptions
- All branding changes maintain the same visual styling and layout
- No database schema changes were required for these updates

## Status

✅ All changes implemented successfully
✅ Linting passed with no errors
✅ Ready for testing
